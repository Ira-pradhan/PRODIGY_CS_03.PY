TASK- 03:
Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. provide feedback to users on the password's strength.


Password Complexity checker:
A Password Complexity Checker is a tool designed to evaluate the strength and security of passwords based on various criteria. The goal of such a tool is to help users create robust passwords that are difficult to guess or crack, thereby enhancing their overall security online. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how a Password Complexity Checker works and the benefits it provides.


Criteria for Password Strength:

Length: The longer, the better. For example, passwords shorter than 8 characters are considered weak.

Uppercase/Lowercase Letters: The inclusion of both increases strength.

Numbers: Adding numbers makes the password harder to guess.

Special Characters: Symbols like !@#$% further improve password strength.


Feedback Levels:

Weak: Password is less than 8 characters or only consists of letters.

Moderate: Password has a mix of letters (upper and lowercase) but lacks special characters or numbers.

Strong: Password contains letters (both cases), numbers, and special characters, with a minimum length of 12 characters.


 How the Tool Works:

The tool checks the password for specific criteria: length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

It provides feedback based on which criteria are met and gives an overall strength rating.
